# NuiSI Dataset

**Nui**track **S**keleton **I**nteraction Dataset of Physical Human-Human Interactions

The actions are the same as those in [BÃ¼tepage et al (2021) "Imitating by Generating: Deep Generative Models for Imitation of Interactive Tasks"](https://github.com/jbutepage/human_robot_interaction_data):

- Waving: Waving at each other
- Handshake: A normal handshake
- Rocket Fistbump: Both persons bump their fists at a waist level and then synchronously move them upwards like a rocket, while keeping contact
- Parachute Fistbump: Both persons bump their fists at a chest/shoulder level and then synchronously oscillate them sideways while coming down like a parachute, while maintaining contact
